          <h1 class="panel-title">Visuals</h1>
          <p class="panel-text">I am a visual artist with nearly 2 years of experience. My art generally has an emphasis on abstraction, colour, and chaos! However, I do love to explore outside my little abstract bubble and play around with environment building, product viz, shader magic, motion graphics, vector illustration, UI design, drawing, or anything else that catches my attention :D</p>

        <div class="panel-green">
          <h1 class="panel-title">Music</h1>
          <p class="panel-text">I'm also a musician! I have 5 years of experience with music production. Although, my public discography is very short, so you won't find much of my music. In music, I just do whatever I fancy! Whether it be Dance, Orchestral, Electropop, Glitch Hop, Future Bass, Synthwave, Ambient, DnB, or anything else that has inspired me.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="panel-blue">
          <h1 class="panel-title">More</h1>
          <p class="panel-text">Apart from my two specialities I've just mentioned, I also dabble in scripting every now and then, experiment with livestreaming, or even try out other mediums of art such as writing and photography!</p>
